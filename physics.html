        <p style="font-size:100%;" style="font-family:georgia;">
          The Tyndall effect is light scattering by particles in a colloid or in a very fine suspension. The intensity of the scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, so blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light. An example in everyday life is the blue colour sometimes seen sun rays in a deep forest where dust particles are suspended.

                           <p style="font-size:100%;" style="font-family:georgia;">

             When a beam of sunlight strikes a molecule in the atmosphere, what's called "scattering" occurs, sending some of the light's wavelengths off in different directions. At sunset, the light takes a much longer path through the atmosphere to the eye than it did at noon, when the sun was right overhead. It means that much of the blue has scattered out long before the light reaches us leaving a disproportionate amount of oranges and reds.

          <p style="font-size:100%;" style="font-family:georgia;">
               When monochromatic light passing through two narrow slits illuminates a distant screen, a characteristic pattern of bright and dark fringes is observed. This interference pattern is caused by the superposition of overlapping light waves originating from the two slits. This is the Young's double-slit experiment.

               <p style="font-size:100%;" style="font-family:georgia;">
                 Electrical power transmission involves the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power station or power plant, to an electrical substation where voltage is transformed and distributed to consumers or other substations.  The combined transmission and distribution network is part of electricity delivery, known as the "power grid".
