          The Tyndall effect is light scattering by particles in a colloid or in a very fine suspension. <br>
          The intensity of the scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, <br>
          so blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light. An example in everyday life is the blue <br>
          colour sometimes seen sun rays in a deep forest where dust particles are suspended.<br>

             When a beam of sunlight strikes a molecule in the atmosphere, what's called "scattering" occurs, <br>
                             sending some of the light's wavelengths off in different directions. At sunset, <br>
                             the light takes a much longer path through the atmosphere to the eye than it did <br>
                             at noon, when the sun was right overhead. It means that much of the blue has <br>
                             scattered out long before the light reaches us leaving a disproportionate amount <br>
                             of oranges and reds.

          <p style="font-size:100%;" style="font-family:georgia;">
               When monochromatic light passing through two narrow slits illuminates a distant screen, <br>
            a characteristic pattern of bright and dark fringes is observed. This interference pattern <br>
            is caused by the superposition of overlapping light waves originating from the two slits. <br>
            This is the Young's double-slit experiment.<br>

               <p style="font-size:100%;" style="font-family:georgia;">
                 Electrical power transmission involves the bulk movement of electrical energy from a <br>
                 generating site, such as a power station or power plant, to an electrical substation <br>
                 where voltage is transformed and distributed to consumers or other substations. <br>
                 The combined transmission and distribution network is part of electricity delivery, <br>
                 known as the "power grid".
