Pandav Nritya chiefly belongs to the Chamoli district and the districts of the Pauli Garhwal. Legend has it that the origins of Pandav Nritya at Uttarakhand can be traced back to the period when Pandavas were the rulers of Uttarakhand. Pandav Nritya seems to be almost synonymous with the 'Dussehra' and 'Diwali' of Uttarakhand, because during this time Pandav Nritya performance becomes mandatory.
            The Baleshwar Temple follows the South Indian school of sculpture and architecture. The temple was built by the first Chand Dynasty king, Raja Somchand. In early 17th century, the Mughals captured Champawat and destroyed the Baleshwar temple. The temple facade is carved out of stone and has arched windows. The architecture is similar to that of Buddhist temple or vihara. The painted facade is typical of the Buddhist temples. The shrine area has an idol of Lord Badrinarayan, carved out of black stone. This idol shows Lord Badrinarayan sitting under a Badri Tree, guarded by a gold canopy.
